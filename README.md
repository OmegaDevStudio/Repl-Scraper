# Scraper

A discord token scraper, designed to scrape forks from replit.com

## Setup

Requires Rust installed with Cargo. You can follow this [guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) here. After that you may run `cargo run --release` and should start running.

If you are too lazy you can contact me on discord and I can send you the executable.
